Long time no see.
Last time I said rails and rails it is !
This time it won't be a step by step tutorial but something a little bit different.
My friend Natalia and I have started making a side project in rails called
TeamView - app for managing people and projects inside teams.
It is an after work thing but every week there are some new pull requests to look at.
Take a look once in a whille how our app is growing. Of course I am here to help and
answer any questions so don't hesitate to write and ask - I is all about sharing knowledge!
Below is a link to our project:

See you soon in another post
