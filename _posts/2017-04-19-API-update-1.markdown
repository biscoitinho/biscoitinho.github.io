Made some changes in mentioned in my previous post
[ruby-api](https://github.com/biscoitinho/ruby-api)


commit:

`add self create table when non-existent`

Which add this code to `config/database.rb`:

```
unless ActiveRecord::Base.connection.data_source_exists?(:games)
  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.create_table :games do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.string :genre
  end
end
```

Thanks to this little unless block now we don't have to make sqlite3
database by ourselfs and then additionally make needed db table.
Now activerecord does it automatically when it detect there is no db.

and a second commit:

`add rspec and basic test`

Which adds rspec testing framework to the `ruby-api` and introduces first
(very) basic test. All of the magic is in the`/spec` folder within
`server_spec.rb` file. To make tests work I nedded to install
`rspec` (obvious) and `rack-test` (see Gemfile).
To make my work easier and faster I've also made a `.rspec` file in
app root directory, thanks to it I now no longer have to write long
rspec commands in terminal, this file does it every time for me.
Instead of `rspec --color --format documentation` I now hit only
`rspec` and the tests fly.

Now I have to update my readme file

Cheers
