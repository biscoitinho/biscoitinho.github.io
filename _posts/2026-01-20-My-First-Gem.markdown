Hi,

As I was making the file for new post I noticed it been 2 years to the day from my last post here.
It's high time to restart the initative to post more frequlently.


On Christmas Eve 2025 I fullfiled one of my small dreams - to be a creator of a ruby gem.
From the moment I started learning Ruby, gems was something magical to me and being an author of one meant
a lot to me.


Also recently I've discovered
[Omarchy linux](https://omarchy.org)
and felt in love with it, this prompted an idea in my head.
Why not make something useful to work in terminal, I decided I'll make my own TUI navigator.
I am aware there are already great tools out there like MC - midnight commander, Ranger, nnn,
and probably lots of others, but they weren't my own and without my twist and ideas.
Main principle was to solve my litle problems when working with command line and to be as simple as
possible, not to bloat it with unnecessary features.


Seargent was born! - a soldier that isn't afraid of any task (at least the ones that he was trained for)

[github.com/biscoitinho/Sergeant](https://github.com/biscoitinho/Sergeant)

[rubygems.org/gems/sergeant](https://rubygems.org/gems/sergeant)

Probably not the best tool in the world, but it my, my own, my precious... ;)

Leave it to the Sarge!

Cheers
