New stuff in
[ruby-api](https://github.com/biscoitinho/ruby-api)


commit:

`rest of basic CRUD tests`

I've wrote 2 new tests:

One for edit action:

```
it "edits a game" do
  game_params = {
    "name" => "chess",
    "genre" => "logical"
  }.to_json

  request_headers = {
    "Accept" => "application/json",
    "Content-Type" => "application/json"
  }

  patch "/api/v1/games/1", game_params, request_headers

  expect(last_response.status).to eq 200
  expect(Game.last.name).to eq "chess"
end
```

We are here editing our "tetris" test example game and changing it to "Chess"
We expect to get `200` status and a record with game name equal to "Chess"

And second for delete action:

```
"deletes a game" do
  request_headers = {
    "Accept" => "application/json",
    "Content-Type" => "application/json"
  }

  delete "/api/v1/games/1", request_headers
  expect(last_response.status).to eq 204
end
```

Here we are deleting our test example with id of 1 and expecting to recive a 204 status.


Everything great but now our new tests don't want to pass, why is that?
Because `DatabaseCleaner` added in previous commit cleans db not only before every whole test suite is started
but also after every test so edit and delete action operates on an empty record and eventually they fail.
Solution for this is simple - we have to reconfigure `DatabaseCleaner` setup in `spec_helper.rb`

```
config.before(:each) do
  DatabaseCleaner.start
end
config.after(:each) do
  DatabaseCleaner.clean
end
```

I've removed this lines above, now `DatabaseCleaner` cleans db only at the begining of a brand new test suite
(after `rspec` command) not after every test case.

Additionally I found a bug/typo in `readme.md` which I've corrected (curl edit example)

Tests are all green, time to play Witcher :)

Cheers
