Javascript the OOP way!

I tried to do some JS frontend stuff lately - it was awful!
I'm not dissing here all those frameworks, it's just me, I utterly hate
frontend stuff. But as I already was in JS so I thought why not do some
stuff in JS but proper object oriented way.
Inspired by
[this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript#Object-oriented_programming)
article at mozilla I've implemented my version of their code:

```
authorObject = {
  firstName: "Mateusz",
  lastName: "Grotha",
  display: function() {
    console.log("Script author: " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
  }
};

authorObject.display();

function LanguageClass(language, style) {
  this.language = language;
  this.style = style;
}

var firstLanguage = new LanguageClass("Ruby", "ruby-way");
var secondLanguage = new LanguageClass("Javascript", "oop");

LanguageClass.prototype.print = function() {
  console.log("My language is " + this.language + " with " + this.style);
};

firstLanguage.print();
secondLanguage.print();

function Logo(language, logotype){
  LanguageClass.call(this, language);
  this.logotype = logotype;
}

Logo.prototype = Object.create(LanguageClass.prototype);
Logo.prototype.constructor = Logo;

Logo.prototype.matchLogo = function() {
  console.log("Logotype of " + this.language + " is " + this.logotype);
};

var rubyLogo = new Logo("Ruby", "Ruby");
var jsLogo = new Logo("Javascript", "Yellow circle with black JS letters");

rubyLogo.matchLogo();
jsLogo.matchLogo();
```

As you propably guess I am runing this in terminal using `node scriptName.js` but you
can also run this in your browser just embed this script in some nice html file.
My thoughts:
I like it a lot! I is now very similar to Ruby which is my first language so writting
JS this way it is more natural to me, and code imho looks much cleaner then writting
it and tossing those functions everywhere.
Maybe JS isn't so bad after all ;)

Cheers
