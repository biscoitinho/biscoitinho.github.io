In my 'spare' time (1am on a week day) I've made
couple of gists involving Python.
Of course don't follow my naming convention with one letter
names for the variables, I'm lazy I admint it, but to my excuse
this is only a gist I wouldn't use it in regular script/app.


First gist is 'the things I always forget or mix up'.
Switching from one language to another got more pros then cons,
you know basic of programming, conventions etc, but syntax sometimes
very simillar could be also very different.

Second one is a basic bootstrap for object oriented programming in Python.
Very basic indeed, but there are a couple of things different then for instance in
Ruby with which I've always tend to mix up python with.

I've got a few more gists there regarding tmux, vim etc, feel free to look them up.
Also I hope to make a couple more of those or update the existing ones.


Cheers
