Ruby - where can I learn it?

I will list sites/resources imho best for starting up and learning what Ruby really is.
I will gradually move from total basics to more advanced stuff, but remember:

> Understanding the basics is the key to the rest

1. [www.tryruby.org](http://www.tryruby.org) - Best place to start, fundamental basics.
When you don't know completly nothing about ruby or any programming language and even
haven't it got installed yet. (free)

2. [codeacademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) - Little more extended topic
as above one, interactive, no need to install anything (free)

3. [AnyOneCanLearnToCode](http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/screencasts) - One of my favs,
and in my opinion pure gold. Short series of screencasts with basics, but brilliantly
explained (ruby should be installed) (screencasts are free)

4. [RubyKoans](http://rubykoans.com/) - My another fav! Touches basic and more complex
aspects and concepts of the language (free) (requires basic knowledge of ruby
and terminal commands)

5. [PoignantGuideToRuby](http://poignant.guide/) - Only book in this sum up. I'm not
a big fan of IT books, they tend to be outdated very quickly (some even before printing)
But this one I can trully recommend (I've got the oldschool printed version). Basics
and more complex things (free or paid)

6. [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/) - More framework specific, personally I'm not
a biggest fan of it, but site got TONS of resources (mostly paid)

7. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Could be first on the list or last.
Could save your butt or dig your grave, but every-single-one programmer is using it

8. Ruby User Group - It is all about community. Meet fellow ruby enthusiasts, learn
from them, help others, become a robust rubist.
