Uff It's been awhile!

Today short one

I made an API in Ruby
It's simple and compact but does the job.
Of course bare in mind that this is initial state of it.
No tests and more refined functionalities yet, but we will get there
Click and try for yourself if you like

More updates soon (I hope)

Cheers
